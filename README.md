# Hirst Painting

Whole project is visible on:
- https://repl.it/join/ckuphnpp-luknplava

Description:
- This project uses two packages:
   - Colorgram -> to extrack colors from an image
   - Turtle -> to do the painting
- The goal of this project is to try copy art from the artist Damien Hirst, who sold the similiar painting for hundred thousands of $

PS
- Sadly replit doesn't support package Colorgram, so in order to use this app with commented section, it is recommended, copy this project in any IDE like Pycharm to install this package
